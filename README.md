# FTC_SDK
This is the repo that holds all the java android stuff
To work with the SDK you need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

To open it, open android studio, click open project, and then select the folder called FTC_SDK.

## Where Things Are :)
The files that really matter are certain java files that FTC calls OPs.
These java files are located in [ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/com/qualcomm/ftcrobotcontroller/opmodes](https://github.com/RoboticColonels/FTC_SDK/tree/master/ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/com/qualcomm/ftcrobotcontroller/opmodes)
They are for setting what controls on the controllers control what things on the robot.
